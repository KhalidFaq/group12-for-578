# Scoring Rubric (Template)

Use this template to justify each numeric score (1–5). Keep short policy excerpts (or section numbers) for traceability.

## Scales
- **1 (Weak)**: Mentions concept vaguely or not at all; no mechanisms defined.
- **2 (Basic)**: Mentions with minimal details; partial mechanisms; few obligations.
- **3 (Moderate)**: Clear requirements but limited scope or weak enforceability.
- **4 (Strong)**: Detailed requirements; clear processes; periodic checks.
- **5 (Very Strong)**: Comprehensive, mandatory, with audits, penalties, and lifecycle controls.
