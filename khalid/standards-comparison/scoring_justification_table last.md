## 📊 Regulatory Comparison Table

| Metric | EU AI Act (2024) | US EO 14110 (2023)* | Saudi SDAIA (2023–25) | Legal / Text Evidence | Explanation |
|--------|:----------------:|:-------------------:|:---------------------:|----------------------|-------------|
| **Human Oversight** | 5 | 4 | 3 | EU: Art. 14; US: EO § 4.1(a); Saudi: AI Ethics Principle 3 (Humanity) | EU mandates human-in-the-loop for high-risk AI systems. US encouraged oversight but left implementation voluntary. Saudi mentions oversight in ethics principles without strict enforcement mechanisms. |
| **Transparency** | 4 | 3 | 3 | EU: Art. 50, Art. 13; US: EO § 8(a); Saudi: AI Ethics Principle 6 (Transparency & Explainability) | EU requires disclosure and explainability for high-risk systems and certain AI interactions. US promoted transparency principles but left implementation flexible. Saudi encourages transparency but lacks binding legal force. |
| **Accountability** | 5 | 4 | 3 | EU: Art. 26, Art. 71; US: EO § 10(b); Saudi: AI Ethics Principle 7 (Accountability & Responsibility) | EU assigns clear legal liability and responsibilities for AI system providers and deployers. US delegated accountability to federal agencies. Saudi assigns moral/ethical accountability without comprehensive legal enforcement. |
| **Privacy Protection** | 5 | 4 | 4 | EU: GDPR + AI Act Art. 10; US: EO § 9; Saudi: PDPL (2023) + AI Ethics Principle 2 | EU directly links AI regulations to GDPR enforcement with strict data protection. US references existing privacy laws and frameworks. Saudi enforces Personal Data Protection Law (effective Sept 2023) alongside AI ethics. |
| **Security & Robustness** | 4 | 5 | 4 | EU: Art. 15, Annex IV; US: EO § 4.1(b) + NIST; Saudi: AI Ethics Principle 5 (Reliability & Safety) | EU enforces mandatory testing and security tiers for high-risk systems. US promoted strong cybersecurity standards via NIST frameworks. Saudi applies resilience and safety standards through ethics framework. |
| **Risk Management** | 5 | 4 | 4 | EU: Art. 6, Art. 9; US: EO § 5 + NIST AI RMF; Saudi: AI Adoption Framework § 3 (Risk Classification) | EU uses proportional risk-based tiers (unacceptable, high, limited, minimal risk). US introduced NIST AI Risk Management Framework. Saudi defines AI risk taxonomy in 2024 Adoption Framework. |
| **Enforcement Strength** | 5 | 3 | 3 | EU: Art. 99; US: EO § 10; Saudi: Voluntary compliance + PDPL penalties | EU allows penalties up to **€35M or 7% of global turnover** (prohibited practices) and **€15M or 3% of turnover** (other violations). US limited to administrative actions. Saudi relies on voluntary compliance with sector-specific enforcement. |
| **Fairness & Bias** | 4 | 4 | 3 | EU: Art. 10, Annex IV(2); US: EO § 7(c); Saudi: AI Ethics Principle 1 (Integrity & Fairness) | EU mandates bias testing and mitigation for high-risk systems. US encouraged fairness principles through OMB guidance and federal agency requirements. Saudi references fairness in ethics but lacks binding testing requirements. |
| **Data Quality** | 4 | 4 | 4 | EU: Art. 10, Annex IV(3); US: NIST AI RMF § 2.3; Saudi: AI Ethics Principle 2 controls | All three frameworks emphasize dataset quality, relevance, and representativeness. EU has audit protocols for high-risk systems. US relies on NIST framework standards. Saudi includes data quality in ethics controls. |
| **Monitoring & Audit** | 4 | 4 | 4 | EU: Art. 72; US: EO § 8(b) + AI Safety Institute; Saudi: AI Adoption Framework § 5 (Compliance) | EU requires post-market monitoring and incident reporting for high-risk systems. US established AI Safety Institute at NIST for testing and evaluation. Saudi establishes auditing and compliance mechanisms in 2024 Framework. |

### Scoring Legend
- **5** - Comprehensive, legally binding, with strong enforcement mechanisms
- **4** - Strong framework with clear requirements or substantial guidance
- **3** - Guidance-based or advisory with limited enforcement
- **2** - Minimal framework or voluntary participation
- **1** - Absent or extremely limited provisions

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### US Executive Order 14110 Status
**\*CRITICAL UPDATE:** Executive Order 14110 was **rescinded on January 20, 2025** by Executive Order 14148 under the Trump administration. The legal status of US federal AI oversight is currently uncertain. Some components, such as NIST frameworks and OMB guidance, may continue through other statutory or regulatory authorities.

Scores for US regulations reflect the framework as it existed under EO 14110. Current enforcement and requirements may differ significantly.

### EU AI Act Penalty Clarification
Maximum administrative fines under Article 99:
- **€35 million or 7% of total worldwide annual turnover** (whichever is higher) for:
  - Prohibited AI practices (Article 5 violations)
  - Non-compliance with general-purpose AI model obligations
- **€15 million or 3% of total worldwide annual turnover** for:
  - Violations of other operator obligations
  - Supplying incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information to authorities

### Saudi SDAIA Framework Nature
The SDAIA AI Ethics Principles are **non-binding guidelines** but are enforced through:
- Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) - binding legislation effective September 2023
- Sector-specific regulators (e.g., telecommunications, healthcare, finance)
- Voluntary compliance certification and badge system
