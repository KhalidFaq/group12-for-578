## 📊 Quick Comparison at a Glance

| Metric | EU AI Act (2024) | US EO 14110 (2023)* | Saudi SDAIA (2023–25) | Where to Find It | Why This Score? |
|--------|:----------------:|:-------------------:|:---------------------:|------------------|-----------------|
| **Human Oversight** | 5 | 4 | 3 | EU: Art. 14; US: EO § 4.1(a); Saudi: AI Ethics Principle 3 (Humanity) | The EU requires humans to be directly involved in high-risk AI decisions. The US encouraged this practice but made it voluntary. Saudi Arabia mentions it in their ethics principles but doesn't strictly enforce it. |
| **Transparency** | 4 | 3 | 3 | EU: Art. 50, Art. 13; US: EO § 8(a); Saudi: AI Ethics Principle 6 (Transparency & Explainability) | The EU demands that companies disclose when you're interacting with AI and explain how high-risk systems work. The US promoted transparency but left companies flexibility in how they implement it. Saudi Arabia encourages openness but hasn't made it legally required. |
| **Accountability** | 5 | 4 | 3 | EU: Art. 26, Art. 71; US: EO § 10(b); Saudi: AI Ethics Principle 7 (Accountability & Responsibility) | If something goes wrong with AI in the EU, there's a clear legal framework for who's responsible. The US delegated accountability to federal agencies. Saudi Arabia emphasizes moral and ethical responsibility without comprehensive legal enforcement yet. |
| **Privacy Protection** | 5 | 4 | 4 | EU: GDPR + AI Act Art. 10; US: EO § 9; Saudi: PDPL (2023) + AI Ethics Principle 2 | The EU connects AI rules directly to their strict GDPR privacy laws. The US references existing privacy protections. Saudi Arabia has enacted a comprehensive data protection law that works alongside their AI ethics framework. |
| **Security & Robustness** | 4 | 5 | 4 | EU: Art. 15, Annex IV; US: EO § 4.1(b) + NIST; Saudi: AI Ethics Principle 5 (Reliability & Safety) | The EU requires mandatory security testing for high-risk systems. The US put strong emphasis on cybersecurity through their NIST standards. Saudi Arabia applies safety standards through their ethics framework. |
| **Risk Management** | 5 | 4 | 4 | EU: Art. 6, Art. 9; US: EO § 5 + NIST AI RMF; Saudi: AI Adoption Framework § 3 (Risk Classification) | The EU uses a sophisticated four-tier risk system to categorize AI (from unacceptable to minimal risk). The US introduced the NIST AI Risk Management Framework. Saudi Arabia has developed their own risk classification system in their 2024 framework. |
| **Enforcement Strength** | 5 | 3 | 3 | EU: Art. 99; US: EO § 10; Saudi: Voluntary compliance + PDPL penalties | The EU has teeth—companies can face fines up to **€35M or 7% of worldwide revenue** for serious violations. The US was limited to administrative actions. Saudi Arabia currently relies more on voluntary compliance with sector-specific enforcement. |
| **Fairness & Bias** | 4 | 4 | 3 | EU: Art. 10, Annex IV(2); US: EO § 7(c); Saudi: AI Ethics Principle 1 (Integrity & Fairness) | The EU mandates that high-risk AI systems must be tested for bias and discrimination. The US encouraged fairness principles through government guidance. Saudi Arabia addresses fairness in their ethics principles but doesn't require binding tests. |
| **Data Quality** | 4 | 4 | 4 | EU: Art. 10, Annex IV(3); US: NIST AI RMF § 2.3; Saudi: AI Ethics Principle 2 controls | All three regions recognize that AI is only as good as its training data. They each have standards ensuring datasets are high-quality, relevant, and representative—though enforcement methods differ. |
| **Monitoring & Audit** | 4 | 4 | 4 | EU: Art. 72; US: EO § 8(b) + AI Safety Institute; Saudi: AI Adoption Framework § 5 (Compliance) | The EU requires companies to continuously monitor high-risk AI and report problems. The US established an AI Safety Institute for testing. Saudi Arabia has set up auditing and compliance mechanisms in their latest framework. |

### What Do These Scores Mean?
- **5** = Comprehensive laws with real consequences for violations
- **4** = Strong framework with clear requirements and guidance
- **3** = Guidance-based approach with limited enforcement
- **2** = Minimal framework or mostly voluntary
- **1** = Little to no regulation in this area

## ⚠️ Critical Updates You Should Know

### 🇺🇸 The US Situation Has Changed
**Important:** On January 20, 2025, the Trump administration rescinded Executive Order 14110, which was the main federal AI policy. This means the legal landscape for AI regulation in the US is now uncertain. 

What remains active:
- NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) frameworks may continue
- Some agency-specific regulations persist
- State-level AI laws are emerging to fill the gap

The scores in this comparison reflect the framework under Executive Order 14110, but remember that enforcement and requirements may now be quite different.

### 🇪🇺 EU Penalties: The Real Numbers
Many sources get this wrong, so here are the actual fines under Article 99:
- **Up to €35 million OR 7% of your company's worldwide annual revenue** (whichever hurts more) for:
  - Using prohibited AI practices
  - Violating general-purpose AI model rules
- **Up to €15 million OR 3% of worldwide revenue** for:
  - Breaking other AI system rules
  - Lying to authorities or providing incomplete information

### 🇸🇦 Understanding Saudi Arabia's Approach
Saudi Arabia's SDAIA principles are currently **guidance rather than hard law**. However, they're enforced indirectly through:
- The Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) - this one has legal teeth, effective since September 2023
- Industry-specific regulators (telecom, healthcare, finance, etc.)
- A voluntary compliance certification system that companies can earn

Think of it as a "carrot and stick" approach—follow the principles and get recognized, or face consequences through other laws.

## 🔍 How We Scored These Frameworks

We evaluated each regulation across ten critical areas of AI governance. Here's what we looked at:

1. **Human Oversight** - Can humans intervene when AI makes important decisions?
2. **Transparency** - Do people know when they're interacting with AI? Can they understand how it works?
3. **Accountability** - If AI causes harm, who's legally responsible?
4. **Privacy Protection** - How well does the framework protect personal data?
5. **Security & Robustness** - Are there requirements for AI systems to be secure and reliable?
6. **Risk Management** - Is there a systematic way to identify and handle AI risks?
7. **Enforcement Strength** - What happens when someone breaks the rules?
8. **Fairness & Bias** - Are there requirements to test for and prevent discrimination?
9. **Data Quality** - Are there standards for the data used to train AI?
10. **Monitoring & Audit** - Must AI be continuously monitored after deployment?

### Our Scoring Criteria
We considered four key factors:
- **Is it binding?** (mandatory law vs. voluntary guidance)
- **How specific?** (detailed requirements vs. general principles)
- **Real enforcement?** (actual penalties, audits, and oversight vs. recommendations)
- **How broad?** (comprehensive coverage vs. limited scope)

## 🌍 Who Do These Rules Apply To?

### 🇪🇺 EU AI Act: The Long Arm of European Law
- **If you're in the EU**: Applies to anyone developing or using AI systems in EU member states
- **If you're outside the EU**: Still applies if your AI's outputs are used in the EU—yes, even if your company is in Silicon Valley or Shanghai
- **Timeline**: Started August 2024, but full requirements phase in through August 2027

**Real talk**: The EU AI Act has extraterritorial reach similar to GDPR. If you want to do business with Europe, you need to comply.

### 🇺🇸 US Framework: It's Complicated
- **What it covered**: Federal government agencies and their contractors
- **Current situation**: Uncertain after the executive order rescission—watch for state laws filling the gap
- **What continues**: Technical standards from NIST and some agency-specific regulations

**Bottom line**: US AI regulation is now a patchwork. States like California, Colorado, and New York are developing their own AI laws.

### 🇸🇦 Saudi Arabia: Building a Framework
- **Scope**: AI systems developed, deployed, or used within Saudi Arabia
- **Enforcement**: Through sector-specific regulators and the Personal Data Protection Law
- **Status**: Actively evolving—expect updates and expansions

**Context**: Saudi Arabia is investing heavily in becoming an AI leader in the Middle East. Their framework is being refined based on international best practices.
